Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

By the way, check out our NEW project AlgoPro (http://algopro.com) for over 60+ video coding sessions with ex-Google/ex-Facebook engineers.

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:
Input: "The cat in the hat"
Output: "ehT tac ni eht tah"
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

Here's a starting point:

class Solution:
  def reverseWords(self, str):
    # Fill this in.

print Solution().reverseWords("The cat in the hat")
# ehT tac ni eht tah
