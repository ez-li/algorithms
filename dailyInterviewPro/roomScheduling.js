Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

By the way, check out our NEW project AlgoPro (http://algopro.com) for over 60+ video coding sessions with ex-Google/ex-Facebook engineers.

You are given an array of tuples (start, end) representing time intervals for lectures. The intervals may be overlapping. Return the number of rooms that are required.

For example. [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)] should return 2.
