/*

Given a nxm matrix that contains '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of ‘islands’. An island is defined as a piece of land that is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

For example, the following grid  contains 3 islands

11000
11000
00100
00011
